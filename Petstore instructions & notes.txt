- Use the terminal command 'npx sequelize-cli db:migrate' to migrate to the latest database version from the migration files.
- Use the terminal command 'npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all' to seed the database with test data.
- Use the included postman collection file to test the endpoints.

- Use the terminal command 'npm test' to run tests, running the tests will reset the database to default seed state.
